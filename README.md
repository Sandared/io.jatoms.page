# JATOMS

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/jatoms-io/io.jatoms.page)

Site is published but not officially started yet, so content and the direction we're moving to might change quite a bit until officially published 

## Goal 
Provide one single source for:
* Theory and practical guidance on what OSGi is, why it exists and how to use it properly
* Questions and answers, battle stories, etc. provided by a community (Chat/Blog)
* (OSGi-compatible libraries, for those that don't provide proper manifests OOTB - Github Artifact Repository, but this is a rather long term goal)
